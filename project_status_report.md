## Technical Implementation Details

### Multi-Stage Book Matching Algorithm

**Implementation:** `book_matcher.py:86-156`

The system uses a sophisticated three-tier matching strategy:

```python
def find_book_across_libraries(self, kobo_book: KoboBook) -> List[BookMatch]:
    """Find a book across all libraries, prioritizing primary library."""
    # 1. Search primary library (MCR) first
    # 2. Search secondary libraries if not found
    # 3. Return all matches with confidence scoring
```

**Matching Process:**
1. **Title Normalization:** Lowercase, remove punctuation, strip articles ("the", "a", "an")
2. **Author Normalization:** Handle "Last, First" ↔ "First Last" format conversion
3. **Exact Match:** Normalized title + author comparison (confidence: 1.0)
4. **Library Priority:** Primary library (MCR) searched first, early return on match
5. **Conflict Detection:** Multiple library matches flagged for manual resolution

**Current Configuration:**
- **Strict Matching Only:** Conservative approach, exact normalized matches required
- **No Fuzzy Matching:** Prevents false positives, requires manual review for uncertainties
- **Primary Library Preference:** MCR library prioritized over secondary libraries

---

## Current System Status

### Functional Features ✅

- **✅ Multi-Library Discovery:** Automatic detection of Calibre libraries with custom column analysis
- **✅ Kobo Data Extraction:** 360 books processed, 30 collections discovered and classified
- **✅ Intelligent Book Matching:** Cross-library search with primary library preference
- **✅ GUI Interface:** Progress tracking, library selection, dry-run mode
- **✅ Configuration Management:** JSON-based settings with automatic library mapping
- **✅ Comprehensive Logging:** Detailed operation tracking with file and console output
- **✅ Backup System:** Automatic metadata.db backup before modifications
- **✅ Dry-Run Mode:** Safe preview of all changes before execution

### Performance Metrics

**Latest Test Run (August 2, 2025):**
- **Books Processed:** 360 Kobo books
- **Libraries Scanned:** 2 Calibre libraries (MCR: 1,720 books, Misc: 346 books)
- **Processing Speed:** ~36 books/second during matching phase
- **Success Rate:** 87% match rate (314 books matched, 46 unmatched)
- **Collections Processed:** 24 unique collections, 4 rating categories identified

---

## Unmatched Books Analysis

### Statistics
- **Total Unmatched:** 46 books (13% of total)
- **With Collections:** 6 books requiring investigation (1.7% of total)
- **Without Collections:** 40 books (expected, no sync needed)
- **Match Success Rate:** 87% for books that should be synced

### Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Issues Identified:**

1. **Title Format Differences** (3/6 cases)
   - Example: "Empty With You Anthology" vs potential "Empty With You" in Calibre
   - Anthology suffix handling needs enhancement

2. **Author Attribution Variations** (2/6 cases)  
   - Example: "akamine_chan" vs potential different format in Calibre
   - Fanfiction username vs display name discrepancies

3. **Missing Books** (1/6 cases)
   - Books exist in Kobo but not imported to any Calibre library
   - Example: "As if I Am Looking in a Mirror" by Nottthebest

### Specific Unmatched Examples

**High-Value Books (with collections):**
```
1. "Empty With You Anthology" by akamine_chan
   Collections: > no band, dark, supernatural, Evergreen
   Status: Read (99% complete)
   
2. "If You Ask Me To" by MyChemicalFallOutBoyRomance  
   Collections: > no band, omegaverse, sweet fluff, Favorites
   Status: Read (100% complete)
   
3. "i still remember how i made you feel" by akamine_chan
   Collections: > band, Favorites
   Status: Read (99% complete)
```

## Outstanding Issues

### High Priority Issues

1. **Manual Conflict Resolution System** ⚠️
   - **Issue:** Books found in multiple libraries need user choice resolution
   - **Impact:** Currently conflicts are detected but not resolved
   - **Effort:** 2-3 days (GUI dialog + conflict handling logic)
   - **Files to modify:** `gui.py`, `sync_engine.py`, `book_matcher.py`

### Medium Priority Issues

2. **Unmatched Book Investigation** 📋
   - **Issue:** 6 books with collections couldn't be matched (likely title/author differences)
   - **Impact:** Missing metadata sync for important rated books
   - **Effort:** 1-2 days (manual investigation + fuzzy matching implementation)
   - **Solution:** Add fuzzy string matching as fallback for failed exact matches

3. **Anthology Title Handling** 🔍
   - **Issue:** Books with "Anthology" suffix may not match base titles
   - **Impact:** 2-3 books affected based on unmatched analysis
   - **Effort:** 1 day (enhance title normalization logic)

### Low Priority Issues

4. **Performance Optimization** ⚡
   - **Issue:** Sequential library searching could be parallelize
   - **Impact:** Currently acceptable (36 books/second), optimization for 1000+ books
   - **Effort:** 1-2 days (async implementation)

5. **Error Recovery Enhancement** 🛡️
   - **Issue:** Limited error handling for corrupted Calibre databases
   - **Impact:** Rare edge case, current error logging sufficient
   - **Effort:** 1 day (additional try/catch blocks)
